things to do for POS

features to implement
    file reading/writing
        transactions
            read
                boot-up only
        orders
            read
                boot-up only
            write
                order created
                order purged
                order received
                order item added

bugs
    register screen
        transaction
            below threshold will spawn an order each time the item is added to a transaction
                should probably check if there is an unreceived order on file that has the item in it
